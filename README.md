#Reflow Cleaner

This extension hopes to clean the HTML that Adobe Edge Reflow makes in order to provide a better starting spot for hand coded projects.

## Author
The author of this extension is Terrence Ryan (https://github.com/tpryan). I merely added a workaround to get the CSS extractor to work again with a new version of Brackets/Adobe Edge Code CC.

## Abilities 
Currently the project does the following:

### HTML
1. Converts id's that you mark in Reflow into elements
1. Removes Clearfix classes
1. Removes textspan id's

### CSS
1. Extracts color information from color, background-color, and background-image gradients.
1. Extracts all font families.
1. Extracts media queries.
1. Extracts gradient code. 

## Future
More stuff. I want it to do more, but I'd love feedback on what that more is.
